    "\n",
    "In order to obtain a data set that we are willing to work with, we must scrape data from pro-football-reference. Our ideal data set will have all of the features mentioned above.

    "\n",
    "# Performance Metric\n",
    "\n",

    "Our estimate for the _Bayes Optimum_ on this problem is 95%. Our justification for our estimate is that we can typically get a good idea of whether or not a player will be all-pro from their yards, touchdowns, and wins. At least for quarterbacks specifically. There are also only a small number of players chosen every season."

    "-   **Collection of Data (1 hour)**\n",
    "    -   During this time, we'd solely focus on collecting data for our data set since our initial data set did not have a lot of information\n",
    "    -   We will web scrape various tables from pro-football-reference\n",
    "    -   We'd also take the time to clean up our data and make sure it's in a form that can be used to build classification models\n",
    "        -   This means removing any missing values and converting categorical features into numerical ones through one hot encoding\n",
    "        -   We'd likely remove any columns that just serve as identifiers, such as name and team\n",
    "-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (3 hours)**\n",
    "    -   We would likely spend the first hour of this task just trying to find useful features by hand\n",
    "        -   We could find statistics about our data such as averages, proportions, maximums/minimums\n",
    "        -   We could perform various groupby's and see if that gives us more insight\n",
    "    -   We'd then spend the next two hours plotting data, analyzing the plots, and making note of any useful information for when we begin building models\n",
    "        -   We would probably create a lot of scatter plots that compare different statistics such as: touchdowns vs assists, where we color the points based on if they were on an All-Pro team or not\n",
    "        -   We would also plot some bar charts for number of touchdowns, assists, etc. for each position\n",
    "        -   Through this data analysis, we hope to find out which features are the most useful in predicting if a player will be on an All-Pro team, allowing us to remove the least useful features\n",
    "-   **Model-Building (3 hours)**\n",
    "    -   The first half of this task would be spent building various classification models\n",
    "        -   We'd build logistic regression models, decision trees, random forests, and stacking classifiers\n",
    "        -   We'd do this by using the various techniques we have learned in class, such as hyperparameter search to determine the best set of parameters for a given model\n",
    "    -   The second half of this task would be spent comparing the models we created\n",
    "        -   Using the F1-score of each model, we'd determine which models had the best balance between recall and precision\n",
    "        -   We'd take the best models and attempt to create new models from them, by either combining them or modifying them slightly\n",
    "        -   Depending on the accuracy of the best models, we'd pick 1-3 models that best predict our target and focus on those specifically\n",
    "-   **Wrap-Up (1 hour)**\n",
    "    -   The last hour of our time would be spent wrapping up anything we'd still be working on at this point\n",
    "    -   We'd take time to make sure our work is well-documented and clear for any outside readers to understand\n",
    "    -   We'd ensure that we properly referenced any outside sources and that we gave credit where credit was due"

    "We believe this project would be useful to include in future Math 475/575 courses. It does a good job of reinforcing the concepts involved with the overall machine learning model building process, since we have to plan out the entire process before doing any actual work. There aren't any changes we would make to the project. We think giving the student freedom to do what they want allows them to explore more options and learn more on their own."
